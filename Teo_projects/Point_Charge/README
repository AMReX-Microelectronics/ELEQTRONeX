This folder contains input files for testing the impacts of point charges on different CNT configurations and a point charge location generator given a specific density of charges.

Using the python notebook, bounds can be created and a random point charge distribution can be generated given a density of charges per nm^3.
The current bounds are those for the topgate gate-oxide region.
The output of the python notebook should be copy and pasted into any new point charge testing script withen the "Point Charges" section. For instance:

##############################
###### Point Charges #########
##############################

charge_density_source.num = 450
charge_density_source.type = point_charge

pc_1.location = -1.24e-09 -4.83e-08 4.06e-09
pc_2.location = -1.20e-09 -6.30e-08 4.20e-09
pc_3.location = -3.03e-10 -1.04e-08 5.79e-09
pc_4.location = -7.49e-10 2.09e-08 4.36e-09
pc_5.location = -7.72e-10 5.44e-08 2.63e-09
pc_6.location = -3.26e-10 5.71e-08 1.40e-09
...

If point charges are placed outside the computational domain, the program will fail to run. 

With the "input_files" folder there are already several random densities for the topgate configuration. There are also cases for a 10nm and 100nm cnt using a single point charge located above the cnt center.
